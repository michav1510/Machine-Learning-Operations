# Your Project Title Here
In this project we are operationalizing Machine Learning tasks and consume them from a REST endpoint.

## Architectural Diagram
The steps below describe the whole procedure from the dataset registration to the REST endpoint consuming.

*Dataset registration, we used the csv from https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv

*AutoML using classification. We are trying to predict the label if it is equal to 0 or 1. So it's a classification problem.

*Deploy the best model. The best algorithm is the Voting Ensemble.

*Consume the best model.

*Create, publish and consume a pipeline.

*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
